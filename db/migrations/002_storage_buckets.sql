-- AracUzmanÄ± Storage Buckets Configuration
-- =====================================================
-- This migration creates storage buckets for avatars and review images
--
-- NOTE: Bucket creation via SQL requires service role or admin privileges.
-- If this fails, create buckets manually in Supabase Dashboard > Storage:
--   1. Create bucket "avatars" with public: true
--   2. Create bucket "review-images" with public: true
-- Then run the policy section below.

-- =====================================================
-- 1. CREATE STORAGE BUCKETS
-- =====================================================

-- Create avatars bucket (user profile pictures)
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'avatars',
  'avatars',
  true,
  5242880, -- 5MB limit
  ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/webp']
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Create review-images bucket (photos attached to reviews)
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'review-images',
  'review-images',
  true,
  10485760, -- 10MB limit
  ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/webp']
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- 2. STORAGE POLICIES
-- =====================================================

    WHERE id = auth.uid()
    AND role IN ('moderator', 'admin')
  )
);

-- Storage buckets created with appropriate policies
-- Next: Run 003_rls_policies.sql for table-level security
